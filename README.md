# Salary Analysis by Undergraduate Major

This is an analysis of earnings by major, both starting and mid-career. I am especially interested in determining the risk associated with majoring in philosophy as an undergraduate. I found that philosophy is among the top 5 riskiest majors, and so contrary to claims made by the philosopy community, an undergraduate major in philosophy doesn't lead to high earning jobs. However, this analysis does not touch on postgraduate degrees such as Ph.D.s or J.D.s. 

The analysis is conducted using pandas and visualized using plotly express.
